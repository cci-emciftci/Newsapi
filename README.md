# Newsapi
This is a demo app which use `Newsapi`

Newsapi project developed with Clean Swift Architecture.

I separate 'Networking' module and main project for increase performance.

I used UserDefaults for 'ReadingList' feature's cache logic but I could use CoreData, Realm, Disk etc.

I used only 'pop' pod with cocoapods for popup animations.
